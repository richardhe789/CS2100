## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains my coursework and implementations for **CS2100: Data Structures & Algorithms**.  
Assignments cover fundamental data structures, algorithm design, and programming techniques in **Java**.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate understanding of:
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Time and space complexity
- Data structure implementation and manipulation
- Algorithmic problem-solving and analysis
