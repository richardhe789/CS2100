Flow of Control
----------------
- Sequential
    - Execute instructions in order
- Method calls
    - Transfer control to method, execute instructions in method, then return with or without a value
- Selection
    - Execute different instructions depending on data
- Looping
    - Repeat a set of instructions for different data
    - Loops: for
        - for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            //statement(s);
        }

        - declare your iterator (i, or whatever)
        - declare your test case
        - increment (or decrement) your iterator
